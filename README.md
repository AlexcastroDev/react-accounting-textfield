# Quick Start

```

Maybe you want to use `yarn`.

```bash
yarn add react-accounting-textfield
```

## imports

Import this module

```javascript
import CurrencyInput from 'react-accounting-textfield'
```

## Styles

If you want a default stylesheet, you should import the style:

```javascript
import 'react-accounting-textfield/dist/styles.css'
```

If you want a flecto theme stylesheet, you should import the style:

```javascript
import 'react-accounting-textfield/dist/theme/flecto.css'
```

## Tests

Storybook provides a clean-room environment for testing components in isolation. Stories make it easy to explore a component in all its variations, no matter how complex.

That means stories are a pragmatic starting point for your UI testing strategy. You already write stories as a natural part of UI development, testing those stories is a low-effort way to prevent UI bugs over time.

```bash
yarn test-storybook
```
